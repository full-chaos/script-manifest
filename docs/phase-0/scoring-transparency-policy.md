# Scoring Transparency Policy (v0)

## Principles

- Transparency over opacity: scoring factors are public.
- Consistency over novelty: changes require a versioned policy update.
- Explainability over mystique: every writer can see score drivers.

## Scoring Components (Planned)

- Competition placements (weighted by competition tier)
- Coverage evaluation scores (provider-calibrated)
- Evaluation count confidence factor
- Time-decay for recency
- Historical badge persistence (not score-preserving)

## What We Publish

- Score formula family and weighting categories
- Tier assignment thresholds (top 25/10/2/1)
- Update cadence (event-driven + nightly recompute)
- Anti-gaming rules and appeals process

## Change Control

- Scoring policy changes must be versioned (`scoring-policy-vN`).
- All changes include rationale and effective date.
- Breaking changes require a 14-day public notice period.
