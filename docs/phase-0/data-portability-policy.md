# Data Portability Commitment (v0)

## Commitment

Writers can export their account data at any time with no paid tier requirement.

## Export Formats

- CSV: profile fields, projects, submissions, placements, coverage scores
- PDF: resume-style portfolio summary and accolade timeline
- ZIP: scripts and uploaded coverage report files

## Delivery SLA

- On-demand exports begin immediately.
- Large exports can be asynchronous, with completion notification.
- Download links expire and require authenticated access.

## Retention and Deletion

- Writers can request account deletion.
- Deletion requests include optional export before purge.
- Audit records required by legal/compliance may be retained with data minimization.
