# Script Access Workflow User Manual

## What this adds

The projects workspace now includes script access request tracking and decision audit history.

## Where to use it

- Open `/projects`.
- Select a project.
- Use `Track access` on a draft to focus on that draft's script ID.

## Actions

1. Click `New access request`.
2. Enter a requester user ID and optional reason.
3. Submit the request.
4. Review pending requests in the audit list.
5. Approve or reject pending requests (with optional decision reason).

## Audit trail fields

Each request stores:

- requester
- owner
- status (`pending`, `approved`, `rejected`)
- request reason
- decision reason
- request/decision timestamps
- decision actor
